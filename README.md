#  Fast Stream EPR Cheatsheet

## Intro

I got fed up of having to cross reference multiple documents when I want to know what a behaviour should look like, so I made this. 

Each behaviour has its definition, strength relations (with definitions) and examples for levels three (HEO/SEO) and four (Grade 7 / 6), 

## Behaviours:

* [Changing and improving](behav/change_improve.md)
* [Communicating and influencing](behav/comm_influencing.md)
