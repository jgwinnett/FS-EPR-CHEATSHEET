#  Fast Stream EPR Cheatsheet

## Intro

I got fed up of having to cross reference multiple documents when I want to know what a behaviour should look like, so I made this. 

Each behaviour has its definition, strength relations (with definitions) and examples for levels three (HEO/SEO) and four (Grade 7 / 6), 

## How to Use 

The easiest way to use this documentation is to view it through the github pages which can be found at the following URL - https://jgwinnett.github.io/FS-EPR-CHEATSHEET/. 

You are, of course, free to clone/fork this repo for use on a local machine, if desired.
